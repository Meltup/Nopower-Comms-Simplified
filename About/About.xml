	<description>Communicate with other factions via Bird Post.
	
"Well technicly you are using animals to power your stuff"
	
- adds 1 message table (comms console)
- adds 1 bird cage (needs food to feed the bird, powers comms console literaly)
- adds 1 trade marker (orbital trade beacon that is fueled by wood)
- adds 1 medieval research project (all buildings in this mod needs this as prerequisite)
	
There are several different textures for the trademarkers and bird cage. you can switch between them by rotating your buildling.
	
(To be correct the message table needs 1 power and the bird cage produces one. It is a bit of a workaround. You can totaly abuse but it is your game, so do to your liking. I just wanted a comms console, which fits with low tech/no gun runs)</description>
